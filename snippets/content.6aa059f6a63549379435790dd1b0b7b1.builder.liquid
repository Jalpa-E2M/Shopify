                            Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and
                            to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at
                            orders@eye-swoon.com This Provision facilitates the
                            prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that
                            may arise between you and EyeSwoon. Arbitration is a
                            form of private dispute resolution in which persons
                            with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit,
                            to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead
                            submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or
                            arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the
                            right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained
                            below), which means you would retain your right to
                            litigate your disputes in a court, either before a
                            judge or jury.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Please read this Provision carefully. It provides
                            that all Disputes between you and EyeSwoon shall be
                            resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration
                            replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of
                            this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a
                            right or opportunity to bring claims in a court,
                            before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or
                            be represented in a case filed in court by others
                            (including, but not limited to, class actions).
                            Except as otherwise provided, entering into these
                            Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate
                            claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or
                            jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and
                            court review of an arbitration award is limited. The
                            arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the
                            same damages and relief as a court (including
                            attorney’s fees).

                            companies, and each of their respective officers,
                            directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute”
                            means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you
                            and EyeSwoon regarding, arising out of or relating
                            to any aspect of your relationship with EyeSwoon,
                            whether based in contract, statute, regulation,
                            ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to,
                            fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or
                            negligence), or any other legal or equitable cause
                            of action or claim for relief, and includes the

                            Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to
                            be given the broadest possible meaning that will be
                            enforced, and shall include any claims against other
                            parties relating to services or products provided or
                            billed to you (such as EyeSwoon’s licensors,
                            suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever
                            you also assert claims against us in the same
                            proceeding.

                            For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or
                            arbitration, you must first give EyeSwoon an
                            opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must
                            commence this process by mailing written
                            notification to EyeSwoon, [Answer #10]. That written
                            notification must include (1) your name, (2) your
                            address, (3) a written description of your Claim,
                            and (4) a description of the specific relief you
                            seek. If EyeSwoon does not resolve the Dispute
                            within 45 days after it receives your written
                            notification, you may pursue your Dispute in
                            arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court
                            only under the circumstances described below.

                            choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by
                            arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be
                            initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT
                            OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM
                            THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the
                            “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this
                            Provision by mailing written notification to
                            EyeSwoon, [Answer #10]. Your written notification
                            must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and
                            (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to
                            resolve disputes with EyeSwoon through arbitration.
                            Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration
                            Provision will have no adverse effect on your
                            relationship with EyeSwoon. ANY OPT-OUT REQUEST
                            RECEIVED AFTER THE OPT-OUT DEADLINE WILL NOT BE
                            VALID AND YOU MUST PURSUE YOUR DISPUTE IN
                            ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT.

                          <p>
                            If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not
                            resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim
                            Resolution) either you or EyeSwoon may initiate
                            arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration
                            Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS,
                            www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and
                            the arbitration will be conducted before a single
                            arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an
                            individual arbitration only, and shall in no event
                            be commenced as a class arbitration or a
                            consolidated or representative action or
                            arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator
                            to decide, including the scope of this Provision.

                          <p>
                            For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less
                            than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
                            Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes
                            involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial
                            Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance,
                            the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of
                            Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available
                            at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For
                            arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive
                            Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS

                            Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS

                            1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event
                            it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
                            Under no circumstances will class action or
                            representative action procedures or rules apply to
                            the arbitration.

                            Because the Platform and these Terms concern
                            interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act
                            (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.
                            However, the arbitrator will apply applicable
                            substantive law consistent with the FAA and the
                            applicable statute of limitations or condition

                            Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an
                            individual basis any relief that would be available
                            pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the
                            power to award relief to, against or for the benefit
                            of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.
                            The arbitrator will make any award in writing but
                            need not provide a statement of reasons unless
                            requested by a party or if required by applicable
                            law. Such award will be final and binding on the
                            parties, except for any right of appeal provided by
                            the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered
                            in any court having jurisdiction over the parties
                            for purposes of enforcement.

                            Location of Arbitration – The arbitration will take
                            place in New York, NY in English language.

                            Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – EyeSwoon
                            will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS
                            hearing fees and any arbitrator's hearing fees,
                            costs and expenses upon your written request to the
                            arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary
                            hearing in the arbitration. You are responsible for
                            all additional fees and costs that you incur in the
                            arbitration, including, but not limited to,
                            attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be
                            awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In
                            addition to any rights to recover fees and costs
                            under applicable law, if you provide notice and
                            negotiate in good faith with EyeSwoon as provided in
                            the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim
                            Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you
                            are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you
                            will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s
                            fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.

                            Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the
                            arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
                            person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over
                            any form of a class or representative proceeding or
                            claims (such as a class action, consolidated action,
                            representative action, or private attorney general
                            action) unless both you and EyeSwoon specifically
                            agree to do so in writing following initiation of
                            the arbitration. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR

                            PROVISION, AS SPECIFIED ABOVE, THIS CLASS ACTION
                            WAIVER WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither you, nor any
                            other user of the Platform can be a class
                            representative, class member, or otherwise
                            participate in a class, consolidated, or
                            representative proceeding without having complied
                            with the opt-out requirements above.

                          <p><strong>Jury Waiver</strong></p>
                          <p>
                            You understand and agree that by entering into these
                            Terms you and EyeSwoon are each waiving the right to
                            a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public
                            court. In the absence of this Provision, you and
                            EyeSwoon might otherwise have had a right or
                            opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a
                            judge or jury, and/or to participate or be
                            represented in a case filed in court by others
                            (including class actions). Except as otherwise
                            provided below, those rights are waived. Other
                            rights that you would have if you went to court,
                            such as the right to appeal and to certain types of
                            discovery, may be more limited or may also be
                            waived.

                          <p>
                            If any clause within this Provision (other than the
                            Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be
                            illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be
                            severed from this Provision, and the remainder of
                            this Provision will be given full force and effect.
                            If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be
                            illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will
                            be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by
                            a court.

                            Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the
                            contrary, we agree that if EyeSwoon makes any change
                            to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice
                            Address), you may reject any such change and require
                            EyeSwoon to adhere to the present language in this
                            Provision if a dispute between us arises.

                            The Parties hereto have expressly required that
                            these Terms and all documents and notices relating
                            thereto be drafted in the English language.

                            EyeSwoon prefers to advise you if we feel you are
                            not complying with these Terms and to recommend any
                            necessary corrective action. However, certain
                            violations of these Terms, as determined by
                            EyeSwoon, may result in immediate termination of
                            your access to this Platform without prior notice to
                            you. The Federal Arbitration Act, the laws of the
                            State of New York, and applicable U.S. federal law,
                            without regard to the choice or conflicts of law
                            provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do
                            not apply. The United Nations on Contracts for the
                            International Sale of Goods and any laws based on
                            the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act
                            (UCITA) shall not apply to these Terms. Except for
                            Disputes subject to arbitration as described above,
                            any disputes relating to these Terms or this
                            Platform will be heard in the courts located in New
                            York County in the State of New York. If any of
                            these Terms is found to be inconsistent with
                            applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted
                            to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no
                            other terms will be modified. EyeSwoon’s failure to
                            enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such
                            term. Except as expressly stated otherwise, these
                            Terms are the entire agreement between you and
                            EyeSwoon and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
                            negotiations, discussions or agreements between you
